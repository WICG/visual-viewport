      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Some user agents have split their viewport into two conceptual viewports, colloquially
        known as the <em>visual</em> and <em>layout</em> viewports. This separation is useful in
        enabling a user agent (UA) with a small screen to allow the user to zoom in on parts of the page
        without causing the page to respond, for example, by obscuring the user's view with
        <code>position: fixed</code> elements. As another example, mobile UAs often provide an <em>on-screen
        keyboard</em> (OSK) for user input. Without the visual/layout split, a <code>position: fixed</code>
        element would be pushed up when the OSK is shown, obscuring the user's view. Informally,
        the layout viewport is what the web page uses when laying out its UI while the visual viewport
        is the box on the page that the user can currently see, accounting for transient UI features like
        pinch-zoom and the OSK.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existing APIs provided by UAs are ambiguous about which viewport they're relative to. For
        example, <code>document.scrollingElement.scrollLeft</code> returns the scroll position of the
        visual viewport while <code>document.scrollingElement.clientWidth</code> returns the width of
        the layout viewport. <code>getBoundingClientRect</code> returns the rect relative to the layout
        viewport while positioning non-fixed elements relative to the layout viewport is difficult. This
        makes building UI that responds to scrolls across mobile and desktop UAs difficult. Worse still,
        there's no way for the developer to be notified when the visual viewport changes. For example,
        the only way to know when the user has zoomed is to poll or listen to touch events and continually
        check <code>window.innerWidth</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Visual Viewport API is designed to provide an explicit mechanism for developers to query and
        potentially modify the properties of the visual viewport. It also introduces events that allow the
        page to listen for changes in the visual viewport, allowing UX that explicitly wants to react to
        these changes to do so. For example, the page could keep a small text-formatting bar above the OSK.
